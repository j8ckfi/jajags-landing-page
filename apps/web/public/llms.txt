## about

jajags.tech is a student-run Hack Club chapter at Jefferson Academy Secondary School in Colorado. Members build tools, write research, and study the systems underneath software. The club's identity is "humanist AI" — approaching technology with the sensibility of the Impressionists: capturing human experience, not just optimizing for metrics.
