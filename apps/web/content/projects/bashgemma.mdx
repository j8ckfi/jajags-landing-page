Fine-tuned FunctionGemma 270M for natural language to bash command translation. The model outputs structured JSON tool calls instead of raw text, making it easy to integrate into pipelines and tools.

## what it does

Give it a natural language query like "find all Python files in the current directory" and it returns valid JSON: `{"name": "find", "arguments": {"name": "'*.py'", "path": "."}}`. Strong on `find` with filters, simple pipelines, and common utilities like `grep`, `ls`, `cat`, `wc`, and `sort`.

## the numbers

| Metric | Baseline | BashGemma |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| NLC2CMD Accuracy | 4.5% | 57.4% |
| Utility Match | 0% | 59.5% |
| Parse Rate | 0% | 99.5% |

Training took 36 minutes on an M4 Max. The model is 540MB and runs fully offline.

## limitations

Complex multi-step operations, utilities not in training data (`rsync`, `tar`), and complex `sed`/`awk` patterns. See the [research paper](/research/bashgemma) for full analysis.
