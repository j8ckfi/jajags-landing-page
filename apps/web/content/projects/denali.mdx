Most AI tools cost money, or have free tiers that throttle you the moment you actually need them. Denali doesn't. It's a full AI chat interface built specifically for students — free to use, no credit card, no trial period.

## what it does

Sign in with Google. Pick a model. Start chatting. That's it.

Under the hood, Denali routes queries across multiple inference providers — so if one is slow or unavailable, traffic shifts automatically. The model selection isn't a gimmick; you can actually switch between providers and see differences in response quality and speed for your specific task.

Tool calling is live and expanding. Currently the model can run code, search the web, and read structured data. More tools are being added.

## why free

The decision to keep it free is intentional. Students shouldn't have to choose between a $20/month subscription and using a three-year-old model. Denali is infrastructure, not a product — it's meant to be there when you need it.

## stack

Next.js frontend, Google OAuth for auth, multi-provider inference backend. Open to contributions.
