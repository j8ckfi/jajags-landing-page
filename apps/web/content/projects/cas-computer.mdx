A single agent that runs end-to-end: it pulls in market data, decides when and what to trade, and places orders on Polymarket and Alpaca. No hand-holding. No manual execution.

## what it does

Data comes in from both venues — order books, prices, event outcomes. The agent evaluates that, applies its logic, and submits trades. Positions are opened and closed autonomously. You set the rules and risk; it does the execution.

## why autonomous

Manual trading doesn't scale. By the time you've checked a screen and clicked, the edge can be gone. cas computer is built to react to the data it sees and to keep running so opportunities aren't missed.

## stack

Polymarket and Alpaca APIs for data and execution. Logic and scheduling are custom; no external signal vendors. Runs continuously and manages its own state.
