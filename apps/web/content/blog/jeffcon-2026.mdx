If you've ever been curious about a career in technology but aren't sure where to start, Jeffcon might be worth a Friday.

Jeffcon is an annual one-day conference hosted by Jeffco's IT department, designed to introduce students to the wide range of careers that fall under the "tech" umbrella. We're not just talking about coding. IT includes cybersecurity, networking, systems administration, tech support, data analytics, and dozens of other paths that don't require you to stare at code all day (unless you want to).

This year's event takes place **Friday, February 6th** at Bear Creek High School. Sessions are led by Jeffco IT staff and professionals from companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Denver Water. The keynote speaker is Weston Kieschnick, a TEDx speaker and author who focuses on leadership and building cultures where people actually want to work.

The practical details: lunch is provided, DHE is offering a $1,500 scholarship, and there are prize giveaways throughout the day.

To attend, you need to be a member of our Hack Club chapter. If you're not already a member, now's a good time to fix that. Registration for Jeffcon closes **January 30th**, so don't wait until the week before.
